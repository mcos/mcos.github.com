title: Shades of Gray
---

I've been doing a lot of thinking over the past few weeks about what I do and what it means. I'm a programmer. I've written tens of thousands of lines of computer code in my career and it struck me that none of what I have produced is tangible in any way.  I'm proud of what I've done in my career, but I can't actually touch or feel what I have made. It's an odd feeling. Computer programs are strange things, they're essentially a way to realise abstract ideas, but they are also abstract.

The strange thing about being a programmer is that when you sit in front of a computer to write some code, you are a writing a solution to a problem, so you tend to get into the habit of thinking that there is always a right way to view the world. It's a funny mentality to fall into, to be so definite and sure about something that isn't actually tangible.

The issue that I've come to thing about is that the world isn't a black and white place where there's always a definite solution to a certain problem, it's that the world is made up of the millions of shades of gray in between where there are no right answers, just answers. It's these shades of gray that make life interesting.
