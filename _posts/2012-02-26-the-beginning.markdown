Welcome to my new blog. It's not my first blog but it's one I intend to keep updated. In the past, I've registered accounts with almost every blogging provider under the sun (Blogger, Wordpress, Tumblr, etc.), as well as trying to host my own implementation, but I've never been happy with the sort of control I have had over my content or how it's posted. I was also not happy using the web to publish things (ironic, since I'm a web developer), it seemed too clunky to actually write anything meaningful from within a browser window. I know that it would have been possible to develop a workflow whereby I could write outside of the browser and then add the content later, but that also felt a little cludgy and didn't fit in with any sort of workflow I was happy with. Since workflow is a big deal for me (I'll write a post on this later on), it meant that I just gave up on the idea of writing and publishing anything meaningful because it was too hard for me to deal with the overhead of a process I couldn't optimize for my needs.

Thankfully, with [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/), I can now manage my workflow in a way that makes sense for me. I can now think of an idea, open my [text editor](http://www.sublimetext.com), jot down my thoughts and push the file to [Github](http://www.github.com) without the overhead of opening my browser and logging into a web application (with the risk of getting distracted by another site, or finding an excuse to check my mail). I'm greatly looking forward to exploring this new way of working and very grateful to Github for providing easy workflows for all sorts of projects for the technically inclined.

As this blog evolves, I'll experiment with its layout and style, however but my first priority is to start generating some meaningful content.
